            <p>She had the eerie <em>premonition</em>   of her impending death. But she decided to move out on that fateful day, braving the odds and ultimately paid the<strong>supreme sacrifice.</strong> For Kudirat Abiola, the heroine of democracy, it was all borne out of her uncommon love, not just for her then incarcerated husband,<strong><em>Chief Moshood Abiola</em></strong>  (of blessed memory) but for her fatherland- the country called Nigeria. Specifically, it was for the enthronement of the dictates of democracy in Africa’s most populous nation.</p>
            
            <p>It has been some <strong>23 nebulous years</strong>  after the tragedy but one can only imagine the heart-rending trauma her seven children went through in those dark days of the Abacha-led military dictatorship. With their famous father in the gulag, losing their mother in that despicable and heartless manner, at the hands of the cruel, callous and conscienceless killers riles beyond tears!</p>
